Assignment 6.1 Final Project Submission

What the project does
- displays fast food restaurants and a hardcoded menu
- prototype order system, connected to a firebase

How users can get started with the project
- this is a react native app using expo cli
- open terminal / command prompt
- mkdir "folder_name"
- expo init "app_name"  (I think this can be skipped, just make another folder and name it)
- choose blank template

- install dependencies: (don't copy paste all, just copy one by one until you reach a comma and also don't include the messages in parenthesis)
> npm install @react-navigation/native,
> npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-reanimated  react-native-gesture-handler,
> npm install @react-navigation/drawer  (didn't use),
> npm install @react-navigation/stack,
> npm install react-native-vector-icons,
> npm install react-native-elements,
> npm install react-native-bouncy-checkbox,
> npm install react-redux,
> npm install reanimated-bottom-sheet (react-native-reanimated already installed by this point),
> npm install lottie-react-native,
> expo install firebase,
> npm install tslib,

- then I guess, download the code.zip
- extract then put it inside the created "app_name_folder"
